Intro:

This is a small script that deals with NMR chemical shift analysis
for gross structure comparison in proteins. The shifts determined experimentally
are compared to the shifts from the references, if it above the listed range the 
amino acid corresponding receives a 1, if it within the range, it recieves a 0,
if it is below, it recieves a -1. 

If there is a pattern of 1's or -1's for more than 4 sequential amino acids, this may
indicate some secondary structure. Agreement between multiple atoms should
correlate if this is accurate.


See the 1994 Wishart paper for background:

Notes:
	results directory:
	Processed Data from Sparky format input.
	
	shifts-ref directory:
	The references for the coiled shifts from the 1994 paper. These were
	provided with the original program developed by Wishart, written in C.
	
	shifts.py: the above noted references in python dict format
